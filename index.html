      <p>My name is Cole and I go to Simpson County Academy I take the computer science course.</p>
      <p>I am making this page to talk about my life-long passion of videogames and game design. My plan for this website is to dedicate a page each to three seperate games that I believe to advance the gaming industry to greater heights from diferrent parts in history.</p>
      <p>The three games I am going to be talking about are</p>
      <li><a href="/reddead/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="/callofcuty/">Call of Duty</a></li>
      <li><a href="/mortalkombat/">Mortal Kombat</a></li>
