    <strong>I have played Red Dead Redemption to the end and then some. This game has been a wonderful gameplay and story experience while the online was fun to play with friends.
    This game has one of the highest ratings from multiple sources such as metacritic, IGN, and PC Gamer. The first Red Dead was a good game but the developers Rockstar really improved upon the design, graphics, and storytelling. The characters Rockstar made for this game are wonderfully made and you can see how they change through the stages of the game.</strong>
